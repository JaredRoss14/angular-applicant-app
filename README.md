# Assignment
Managers want to be able to browse, sort, and filter job applications they receive on a web dashboard that they can use across a variety of devices. They would like to be able to inspect an individual application to see more details, as well as flag applications to look at later or revisit. When the manager comes back to the application, this list should still be available to them.

The task is to build a prototype for the dashboard of this application in JavaScript. It will use a JSON-formatted data file as the list of job applications. What you deliver should be everything needed to run the application. 

Requirements
- Dashboard should show a list of all applications with the ability to sort and filter
- Manager should have the ability to favorite or bookmark an application for later viewing
- Details of a specific application should be accessible

Example Data
You can assume that the data file will always be valid JSON. For experience, you can assume number of years, months, etc. Ideally you will package your own data file with your code for examination.
